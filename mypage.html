        <p>
            I have been awoken by 3 differnt people having seizures on me.
            I ski for the CU Freeski team and like big jumps.
            I grew up on a corn and hay farm but never had to farm the corn nor hay.

            I want to implement blockchains to give power to artists, jounralists, and
            other creators. To do that I need to be full stack and display 
            compitance to anyone who would buy into a system. Paying for a degree
            helps that case immensly.
